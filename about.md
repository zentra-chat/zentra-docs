# About

This is the about page of the Zentra documentation.

Zentra is a modern, open-source, and self-hostable alternative to Discord.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide a safe and open platform for communities to communicate and share ideas.

## Our Values

* Freedom: We believe that users should have control over their data and be able to choose how they want to use our platform.
* Openness: We believe that open-source software is the best way to ensure that our platform is secure, transparent, and community-driven.
* Community: We believe that communities should be able to choose how they want to run their servers and what features they want to use.
* Safety: We believe that safety should be a top priority for any platform, and we take steps to ensure that our platform is safe and secure for all users.
